## Motivation
As a coding bootcamp student
I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Description
A timed multiple choice quiz that subracts from the time left if a given answer is incorrect. Used a loop to display the questions and choices, added event listeners to check if the answer given was correct. If all questions are answered or time is up, it will alert that the quiz is finished and will display the number of incorrect and correct answers and the score (time + number correct/incorrect). Then the user can put in their name, and save it to local storage. When they click the button, all the scores that are currently stored will display in the header.

## Framework
* JavaScript 
* Local Storage 
* HTML 
* CSS
